## 🔐 Featured Projects

### 🛡️ [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/aBdUl-AhaD02/Network-Intrusion-Detection-System)
**Snort 3.10.0.0 | Linux | PCAP Analysis**

Built and configured a comprehensive IDS with 4,875 detection rules to monitor network traffic. Created custom signatures to detect exploitation attempts, shellcode injection, ARP spoofing, and various attack patterns. Analyzed PCAP files to extract indicators of compromise and optimized rules for improved detection accuracy.
